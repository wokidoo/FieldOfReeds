**Field of Reeds** is **3D dev tool** project built with the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). It provides procedural terrain generation, dynamic environmental interactions, and other advanced mechanics to enhance 3D world creation.

🚀 **Key Features:**  
✔ **Procedural Terrain Generation** – Create expansive, semi-random landscapes.  
✔ **Dynamic Environments** – Realistic world interactions with environmental effects.  
✔ **Optimized Performance** – Efficient algorithms for smooth rendering.  
✔ **Easy Integration** – Designed to be modular and extendable for various projects.

## 🌍 Procedural Terrain Generation  

Field of Reeds features a **robust procedural terrain system**, allowing developers to generate unique 3D landscapes dynamically. Using Godot’s [FastNoiseLite](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_fastnoiselite.html), terrain can be shaped with custom parameters for infinite creative possibilities.

## 🌬️ Dynamic Environment  

With the **environment manager system**, the world reacts to environmental conditions such as **wind** and other real-time physics interactions, adding realism and immersion.
